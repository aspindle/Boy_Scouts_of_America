I think the BSA program died when it decided to mix the two sexes, or at the very least needs a huge rewrite. 

I also think the Scout Law (Trustworthy, Loyal...) should be the same for both programs/sexes and find it strange that it isn't.

Lastly, I'd remove any cookie/popcorn sales, but I'd budge on that one. 

With regard to Copyright, if you are mad about me posting >10 year old versions of these books, please rethink your priorities. 

In other words, we can have that conversation after you've retired a US flag ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ by burning it ğŸ”¥
